Open Source License – Weam

Weam is licensed under a modified version of the Apache License 2.0 with the following extra conditions.


✅ What You Can Do

- ✅ Use Weam for commercial or non‑commercial deployments inside a single organization.
- ✅ Use Weam to build and deliver solutions for your clients, as long as each client runs on its own **dedicated infrastructure** (not shared across multiple clients).
- ✅ Contribute improvements or fixes under an open development model.

> We encourage innovation and collaboration — but please read the full license before deploying or redistributing.


❌ What You Cannot Do (without a commercial agreement)

- ❌ Offer Weam (or a modified version) as a hosted SaaS or managed service for multiple customers.
- ❌ Run multi‑tenant or separate single‑tenant instances for unrelated third parties.

> If you want to provide Weam as a service to others, you must get a commercial license from Weam AI Pvt Ltd.

Additional Conditions

1. Contributions

- By contributing code, you allow the maintainers to include it in future versions under different licensing** (more restrictive or more permissive).
- Your contributions may be used in commercial products run by the maintainers (e.g., Weam Cloud).
- Contributors are still bound by the “no SaaS” rule above.

2. Third‑Party Dependencies

- If you modify or redistribute third‑party packages bundled with Weam, you must comply with those packages’ licenses.

3. Warranty Disclaimer

> The software is provided “as is” with no warranties of any kind.  
> The licensor is not liable for any damages from using or being unable to use the software.


Other than these specific conditions, all terms of the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) apply.
