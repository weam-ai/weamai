## What is Weam AI

Weam is an open source platform that helps teams adopt AI systematically. It includes a complete, production-ready stack with Next.js frontend and Node.js/Python backend - ready to deploy and use immediately.

**System Requirements:** CPU with 4+ cores, 8GB+ RAM. Professional installation support available for non-technical teams.  

**Getting Started:** Simply download or fork the repository and self-host it on your infrastructure.

**Why Weam?**  
Modern teams need easy access to the latest AI models. Weam connects to all major LLM providers out of the box - just add your API keys and you're ready to go. Think of it as ChatGPT built specifically for teams.  
All your organization's AI interactions live in one centralized platform, organized into "Brains" (intelligent folders). These Brains contain not just chat histories, but also your custom prompts and AI agents. You can structure Brains around your departments - Marketing, Sales, Engineering, Support - whatever fits your organization.

But we didn't stop at chat. Weam is built to grow with your needs. Customize existing features or add entirely new AI applications. With the rise of AI-powered development tools like Loveable and Cursor, your team can rapidly build custom AI apps. Instead of scattered deployments, bring these apps into Weam where your entire team already works. We're building a library of open source AI apps you can use as-is, customize, or use as inspiration for your own.

**Bottom line:** You get a production-grade AI platform that's ready to deploy today and can expand as your needs grow. Completely free and open source. 

**Prefer a managed solution?** We offer a cloud-hosted version of the same open source platform. [**Sign up for a demo here**](https://app.weam.ai/register).
