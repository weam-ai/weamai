class ToolServiceDescription:
    WEB_ANALYSIS = '''
    Deeply analyze multiple or single webpages or URLs provided by the user.
    
    Functionality:
    - Fetch and parse page content: text, images, metadata.
    - Generate structured summaries.
    - Highlight important sections.
    - Extract entities, identify sentiment, themes, and key statistics.

    Parameters:
    - original_query (str): The current user's input query. **Do not modify** this parameter.
    - implicit_reference_urls (List[str]): A list of URLs that are implicitly referenced in the user's query.

    Runtime Behavior:
    - STRICTLY: Only the `implicit_reference_urls` parameter should be passed to the tool at runtime.
      This list must include all URLs implicitly referenced by the user's query.
    - Do not invoke this tool more than once per user query — all relevant URLs must be included in a **single call**.
    - Use `implicit_reference_urls` only when the user query **does not explicitly contain a URL**, 
      but instead refers to previously mentioned or related pages.
    '''
    WEB_SEARCH_PREVIEW='''
    Web Search Tool:-
    This tool is designed to retrieve accurate and up-to-date information from the internet through contextual web search. It should be strictly used when the user query involves real-time events, live updates, or current data that is likely to change frequently or be time-sensitive.
    Use this tool when:
    The query relates to ongoing events, current news, stock prices, weather, sports results, or the latest product or policy updates.
    The answer depends on local or time-based context, such as business hours, event schedules, trending topics, or regional availability.
    The user explicitly requests the most recent, latest, live, or current information.
    '''
    IMAGE_GENERATION="""An image generation and modification tool that enables users to create images from text descriptions and make various visual changes to the generated images.
